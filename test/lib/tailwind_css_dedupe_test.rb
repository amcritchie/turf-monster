# Regression guard for the 2026-07 application.css dedupe (task
# dedupe-turf-application-css). The Tailwind v4 migration left ~40% of the
# file self-duplicated: the hold-button component existed twice (once inside
# @utility hold-btn, once as eight bare utilities), .nav-emoji-swap and the
# toast z-index vars were defined both unlayered and inside @layer utilities,
# and @utility px-1 shadowed the core Tailwind utility with an identical
# value. These tests assert the positive invariants so any re-introduced
# duplicate fails loudly, whatever its spelling.
