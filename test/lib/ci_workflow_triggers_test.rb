# frozen_string_literal: true

# Guard test for .github/workflows/ci.yml's PUSH TRIGGERS — the contract that every
# SHIPPABLE TIP earns an independent clean-env CI verdict.
#
# Ported from mcritchie-studio PR #512 (feat/run-ci-on-release-branch, the pass-3
# guard) for task ci-on-satellite-release. Keep the two copies in sync deliberately,
# not automatically — if the studio guard grows a vector, port it here on purpose.
#
# Why this test exists: `pull_request` only certifies a PR's own head. The sweep
# (`bin/release prepare`, run from mcritchie-studio) merges several approved PRs into
# this repo's `release` branch, producing a NEW merge-commit SHA whose COMBINED
# behavior no CI run has executed. That merge commit is what QA deploys and what
# `bin/release ship` fast-forwards into `main`. Until task ci-on-satellite-release,
# turf-monster triggered CI on `main` only — the release tip shipped with the local G3
# gate as its sole verdict. Dropping `release` from the push trigger silently restores
# that blind spot with no other test failing, so this asserts it directly.
#
# Run directly:
#   ruby -Itest test/lib/ci_workflow_triggers_test.rb
# Also picked up by the normal `bin/rails test` sweep.
#
# HOW TO EXTEND THIS FILE — read before adding a vector.
#
# This guard was blocked THREE times in review of mcritchie-studio PR #512, and every
# hole had the same shape: the guard enumerated the ways the suite might NOT run, and
# each reviewer found a spelling one level of nesting away from where the last one
# looked (`github.ref` → missed `event_name`; job-level → missed step-level). A
# blacklist only ever catches the vectors its author already imagined. It is a
# scoreboard, not a guard.
#
# So the PRIMARY guard here is POSITIVE and lives in
# `test_integration_the_suite_runs_UNCONDITIONALLY_on_a_release_push`: some step must
# actually invoke the suite (TEST_COMMAND), and the lane that does must carry NO `if:`
# at all. That closes the whole CLASS — `env.SKIP_TESTS`, `inputs.fast`, a matrix flag,
# and every spelling not yet invented fail it, without anyone having to predict them.
# The enumerated list below is DEFENSE IN DEPTH behind it. When you add a vector, ask
# first whether the positive invariant already covers it; prefer strengthening that.
#
# SEVEN ways the release tip loses its verdict while `branches: [main, release]` still
# reads correct in the file — all seven asserted, because a guard is only worth the
# regressions it actually catches:
#   1. the branch is dropped from the push trigger (the obvious one);
#   2. a job opts out via a job-level `if:` on the github event context — `github.ref`,
#      `github.event_name == 'pull_request'`, or `github.base_ref`. The job reports a
#      GREEN required check having run zero tests on the RC tip;
#   3. the same `if:` moves onto the load-bearing STEP — the worse spelling, because the
#      job's other steps still succeed, so the job (and the required check) stays green
#      over zero tests. Job-level detection alone misses it (hole found in the second
#      review pass of mcritchie-studio PR #512);
#   4. a `paths`/`paths-ignore` filter on the push trigger suppresses the workflow RUN
#      outright, so a docs-only release merge commit gets no CI at all;
#   5. a `concurrency:` group lets a rapid second release push cancel or supersede the
#      first SHA's run — `cancelled` reads as RED to a SHA-addressed auditor: a false
#      alarm on a healthy candidate. Back-to-back release pushes are normal (sweep
#      merge, then re-pin);
#   6. `continue-on-error: true` on the suite's job or step — the INVERSE trick: the lane
#      RUNS, the tests FAIL, and it reports GREEN anyway. Zero-tests-green and
#      failing-tests-green are the same lie told to the RC tip;
#   7. the suite COMMAND itself is gutted — `run: echo "skipping"`, the `test` job
#      deleted or renamed, the command narrowed to a single file. No `if:`, no filter, no
#      `continue-on-error`: there is NOTHING for a blacklist to match, which is precisely
#      why the positive invariant has to be the primary guard. (6 and 7 were both
#      mutation-confirmed FALSE-GREEN against the blacklist alone.)
#
# CONSIDERED AND DELIBERATELY NOT ASSERTED — do not add these without a reason:
#   · a `matrix:` whose `exclude` empties the job → zero job instances, so the check is
#     MISSING, not green. Missing is a no-verdict, which fails SAFE: required checks
#     block and the auditor sees no data. Only false GREEN is silent.
#   · a `needs:` on a job that never runs → the dependent is skipped transitively, but
#     the ROOT skip is already caught by vectors 2/3. Asserting the transitive case adds
#     nothing the root doesn't.
#   · `if:` on the `on:` block itself → GitHub Actions has no such construct. N/A.
#   · branch-protection / required-check configuration → real, and a genuine way to
#     accept a green-with-no-runs tip, but it lives in GitHub settings, not in this repo.
#     Out of this file's contract; worth its own audit.
#
# NOTE the DOUBLE RUN the trigger creates, so nobody "fixes" it into hole #5: a release
# SHA gets its run from `push: release`, then `bin/release ship` fast-forwards main to
# the byte-identical SHA and fires a SECOND full run (including the test + test:system
# lane). Benign — the SHA-addressed auditor folds a pending duplicate as no-data, never
# a block — and expected.
#
# Two tiers (backend shape):
#   [unit]        the trigger-extraction and skip-detection logic, over fixture YAML —
#                 including the `on:`-parses-as-`true` trap that makes a naive guard
#                 vacuous, and each opt-out spelling above.
#   [integration] the REAL committed ci.yml satisfies the contract (both tips covered,
#                 pull_request intact, no job skipped, no path filter).
