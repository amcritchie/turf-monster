# frozen_string_literal: true

# Guard test for .github/workflows/ci.yml's PUSH TRIGGERS — the contract that every
# SHIPPABLE TIP earns an independent clean-env CI verdict.
#
# Ported from mcritchie-studio PR #512 (feat/run-ci-on-release-branch, the pass-3
# guard) for task ci-on-satellite-release. Keep the two copies in sync deliberately,
# not automatically — if the studio guard grows a vector, port it here on purpose.
#
# Why this test exists: `pull_request` only certifies a PR's own head. The sweep
# (`bin/release prepare`, run from mcritchie-studio) merges several approved PRs into
# this repo's `release` branch, producing a NEW merge-commit SHA whose COMBINED
# behavior no CI run has executed. That merge commit is what QA deploys and what
# `bin/release ship` fast-forwards into `main`. Until task ci-on-satellite-release,
# turf-monster triggered CI on `main` only — the release tip shipped with the local G3
# gate as its sole verdict. Dropping `release` from the push trigger silently restores
# that blind spot with no other test failing, so this asserts it directly.
#
# Run directly:
#   ruby -Itest test/lib/ci_workflow_triggers_test.rb
# Also picked up by the normal `bin/rails test` sweep.
#
# HOW TO EXTEND THIS FILE — read before adding a vector.
#
# This guard was blocked THREE times in review of mcritchie-studio PR #512, and every
# hole had the same shape: the guard enumerated the ways the suite might NOT run, and
# each reviewer found a spelling one level of nesting away from where the last one
# looked (`github.ref` → missed `event_name`; job-level → missed step-level). A
# blacklist only ever catches the vectors its author already imagined. It is a
# scoreboard, not a guard.
#
# So the PRIMARY guard here is POSITIVE and lives in
# `test_integration_the_suite_runs_UNCONDITIONALLY_on_a_release_push`: some step must
# actually invoke the suite (TEST_COMMAND), and the lane that does must carry NO `if:`
# at all. That closes the whole CLASS — `env.SKIP_TESTS`, `inputs.fast`, a matrix flag,
# and every spelling not yet invented fail it, without anyone having to predict them.
# The enumerated list below is DEFENSE IN DEPTH behind it. When you add a vector, ask
# first whether the positive invariant already covers it; prefer strengthening that.
#
# SEVEN ways the release tip loses its verdict while `branches: [main, release]` still
# reads correct in the file — all seven asserted, because a guard is only worth the
# regressions it actually catches:
#   1. the branch is dropped from the push trigger (the obvious one);
#   2. a job opts out via a job-level `if:` on the github event context — `github.ref`,
#      `github.event_name == 'pull_request'`, or `github.base_ref`. The job reports a
#      GREEN required check having run zero tests on the RC tip;
#   3. the same `if:` moves onto the load-bearing STEP — the worse spelling, because the
#      job's other steps still succeed, so the job (and the required check) stays green
#      over zero tests. Job-level detection alone misses it (hole found in the second
#      review pass of mcritchie-studio PR #512);
#   4. a `paths`/`paths-ignore` filter on the push trigger suppresses the workflow RUN
#      outright, so a docs-only release merge commit gets no CI at all;
#   5. a `concurrency:` group lets a rapid second release push cancel or supersede the
#      first SHA's run — `cancelled` reads as RED to a SHA-addressed auditor: a false
#      alarm on a healthy candidate. Back-to-back release pushes are normal (sweep
#      merge, then re-pin);
#   6. `continue-on-error: true` on the suite's job or step — the INVERSE trick: the lane
#      RUNS, the tests FAIL, and it reports GREEN anyway. Zero-tests-green and
#      failing-tests-green are the same lie told to the RC tip;
#   7. the suite COMMAND itself is gutted — `run: echo "skipping"`, the `test` job
#      deleted or renamed, the command narrowed to a single file. No `if:`, no filter, no
#      `continue-on-error`: there is NOTHING for a blacklist to match, which is precisely
#      why the positive invariant has to be the primary guard. (6 and 7 were both
#      mutation-confirmed FALSE-GREEN against the blacklist alone.)
#
# CONSIDERED AND DELIBERATELY NOT ASSERTED — do not add these without a reason:
#   · a `matrix:` whose `exclude` empties the job → zero job instances, so the check is
#     MISSING, not green. Missing is a no-verdict, which fails SAFE: required checks
#     block and the auditor sees no data. Only false GREEN is silent.
#   · a `needs:` on a job that never runs → the dependent is skipped transitively, but
#     the ROOT skip is already caught by vectors 2/3. Asserting the transitive case adds
#     nothing the root doesn't.
#   · `if:` on the `on:` block itself → GitHub Actions has no such construct. N/A.
#   · branch-protection / required-check configuration → real, and a genuine way to
#     accept a green-with-no-runs tip, but it lives in GitHub settings, not in this repo.
#     Out of this file's contract; worth its own audit.
#
# NOTE the DOUBLE RUN the trigger creates, so nobody "fixes" it into hole #5: a release
# SHA gets its run from `push: release`, then `bin/release ship` fast-forwards main to
# the byte-identical SHA and fires a SECOND full run (including the test + test:system
# lane). Benign — the SHA-addressed auditor folds a pending duplicate as no-data, never
# a block — and expected.
#
# Two tiers (backend shape):
#   [unit]        the trigger-extraction and skip-detection logic, over fixture YAML —
#                 including the `on:`-parses-as-`true` trap that makes a naive guard
#                 vacuous, and each opt-out spelling above.
#   [integration] the REAL committed ci.yml satisfies the contract (both tips covered,
#                 pull_request intact, no job skipped, no path filter).

  # ---- the POSITIVE invariant's machinery --------------------------------------------

  # THE COMMAND THAT CONSTITUTES A VERDICT — pinned to the REAL suite invocation, and
  # anchored to the WHOLE LINE. If no lane runs this on a release push, the RC tip's
  # green check is backed by zero tests — and a SHA-addressed CI auditor
  # (mcritchie-studio #514) would read that empty-but-green run as a CLEAN verdict and
  # certify it.
  #
  # THE MUTATION LADDER THIS CONSTANT CLIMBED — each rung was a REAL silent false green
  # a reviewer proved against the rung below, so do not loosen it without climbing back:
  #   1. /bin\/rails\b[^\n]*\btest\b/ — a keyword sniff. `:` is a word boundary, so
  #      `\btest\b` matched inside `db:test:prepare`, and a bare `test` rode in
  #      `runner -e test …`. A prepare-only gut, and the e2e SEED step, counted as the
  #      verdict lane — so DELETING the entire rails `test` job stayed GREEN.
  #   2. `…test:system(?!\S)` — pinned, but only forbade a non-space IMMEDIATELY after.
  #      APPENDING a filter (`… test test:system -n /nothing_matches_this/`) still
  #      counted: zero tests run, guard GREEN. The flag someone adds to quiet a flaky
  #      lane sails through (Avi's catch).
  #   3. `^\s*…\s*$` — anchored BOTH ends, so the pinned command must be the ENTIRE line.
  #      This also closes two vectors the trailing anchor alone did NOT: a COMMENTED-OUT
  #      suite line (`# bin/rails db:test:prepare test test:system` — matched, ran
  #      nothing), and a SHORT-CIRCUIT prefix (`true || bin/rails …` — matched, never
  #      executed). Both were live under rung 2.
  # Each rung is pinned by a refutation fixture below (`…prepare_only…`,
  # `…runner_seed_step…`, `…appended_filter…`, `…commented_out…`, `…short_circuit…`).
  #
  # WHAT THIS PROVES — and NOTHING MORE. Read this before you widen the claim again.
  #
  # This guard has now been blocked FIVE times, and TWICE the block was not a missing
  # vector but an OVERCLAIM in this very comment. The claim "any workflow-file mutation of
  # the suite lane fails safe" was written here — and then falsified the same week by two
  # workflow-file mutations that sailed straight through (a workflow-level `env:`, and the
  # `TEST` key). An overclaimed guard is the same lie it exists to catch: it tells the next
  # reader the class is closed, so they stop looking. So the claim is now an ENUMERATION,
  # not a universal:
  #
  #   PROVEN (each pinned by a refutation fixture, each mutation-verified RED against the
  #   REAL ci.yml, each having been GREEN before its rung):
  #     · the suite lane must EXIST and run the pinned command as a whole line — gutted,
  #       narrowed with an appended flag, commented out, short-circuited, or deleted → RED;
  #     · it must be UNCONDITIONAL — no job-level or step-level `if:` on the event context;
  #     · it must not be neutered by `continue-on-error`, a `paths` filter, a `concurrency`
  #       group, or a dropped branch;
  #     · it must not be NARROWED by an env var Rails actually reads (NARROWING_ENV_KEYS),
  #       at ANY of the FOUR scopes that reach the suite step — the workflow `env:`, the
  #       job `env:`, the step's own `env:`, and the DYNAMIC one: a `$GITHUB_ENV` write
  #       from an EARLIER step in the same job, which the runner exports to every
  #       subsequent step. (This bullet said "the three scopes GitHub honors" until a
  #       reviewer demonstrated the fourth, with the suite step byte-identical and
  #       unconditional, running zero tests, green. The count was the tell: I had asserted
  #       a closed set without enumerating what could write to it.)
  #
  #   NOT PROVEN — the honest edges, so nobody mistakes silence here for safety:
  #     · anything OUTSIDE this YAML. Neuter `bin/rails`, `Rakefile`, `test_helper.rb`, or
  #       a vendored gem, and the pinned command runs over an empty suite; this file reads
  #       the workflow, so it cannot see that. (A tampered-suite guard would be its own
  #       test, and a worthwhile one.)
  #     · indirection the pattern cannot follow — a composite action, a reusable workflow
  #       (`uses:`), or a `shell:` wrapper that runs the suite somewhere this file cannot
  #       read.
  #     · GitHub-side configuration: branch protection, required-check selection, a
  #       disabled workflow. Real ways to accept a green-with-no-runs tip; all live in
  #       settings, not the repo. Worth their own audit.
  #     · NARROWING_ENV_KEYS is a claim about railties 8.1.3, verified by grep at the time
  #       of writing — not a law. Re-verify it on a Rails upgrade.
  #
  # The right instinct on reading this list is NOT "the class is closed." It is "here is
  # where I would look next."
  TEST_COMMAND = /^\s*bin\/rails\s+db:test:prepare\s+test\s+test:system\s*$/

  # Env keys that NARROW the suite to a subset (or to nothing) while the COMMAND on the
  # line stays BYTE-IDENTICAL to the real invocation. The anchored pattern above cannot
  # see any of them — only this walk can.
  #
  # VERIFIED against railties 8.1.3 (`grep -rn 'ENV\[' .../rails/test_unit/`), because
  # the first cut of this list guarded a key Rails NEVER READS (`TESTS` — zero hits in
  # the gem) while missing the live ones. A guard aimed at a dead key is decoration.
  # Re-run that grep on a Rails upgrade; this list is a claim about railties, not a
  # guess:
  #   TEST                 testing.rake:10 — `run_from_rake("test", Array(ENV["TEST"]))`.
  #                        `TEST=test/foo_test.rb` → that ONE file runs, exit 0. SILENT.
  #   TESTOPTS             runner.rb:52 — Shellwords-spliced into the spawned command.
  #                        Applies to `test:system` too (same run_from_rake path).
  #   DEFAULT_TEST         runner.rb:117 — overrides the glob `test/**/*_test.rb`.
  #   DEFAULT_TEST_EXCLUDE runner.rb:121 — excludes it. `'test/**/*_test.rb'` → 0 runs,
  #                        exit 0: a green required check over an EMPTY suite. SILENT.
  #
  # LOUD vs SILENT — measured, because it changes which payload actually threatens the RC,
  # and the obvious one is NOT the dangerous one:
  #   · `TESTOPTS='-n /nothing_matches_this/'` → 0 runs, exit **1**. LOUD: minitest fails
  #     the lane, CI goes red, everybody sees it. It is the spelling people reach for, and
  #     it is the one that cannot hurt you.
  #   · `TESTOPTS='-n /<a small PASSING subset>/'` → a couple of runs, exit **0**. SILENT.
  #     This is why TESTOPTS stays on the list — for the subset spelling, not the zero one.
  #   · `TEST=<one passing file>` → that file's runs, exit **0**. SILENT.
  #   · `DEFAULT_TEST_EXCLUDE='test/**/*_test.rb'` → 0 runs, exit **0**. SILENT, and the
  #     purest of the set: an EMPTY suite reporting success.
  # A guard tuned to the loud payload guards the one CI already catches. Tune to the quiet
  # ones. (Measured on this repo's real rake command; exact run COUNTS are deliberately not
  # pinned here — they drift with the suite and a stale number in a comment is its own
  # small lie. Re-measure, don't cite.)
  #
  # THE MECHANISM, so the next person tests the right path: the suite line is a MULTI-TASK
  # RAKE invocation (`db:test:prepare test test:system`), which routes through
  # `Rails::TestUnit::Runner.run_from_rake` — that is where TESTOPTS is spliced and where
  # the TEST/DEFAULT_TEST globs are read. The `bin/rails test <file>` COMMAND path does
  # NOT read TESTOPTS, so an experiment run that way comes back clean and the hole hides.
