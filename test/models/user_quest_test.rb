# Quest-flow HARDENING — the server-side gates ("things you can't do").
#
# The on-chain SeedGrant PDA is the hard once-ever guard (can't unit-test
# without devnet); these pin the Ruby flags + the derived quest ladder that gate
# the contest-card UI and the controller seed payloads. See User#first_username_change?,
# #first_chat_message?, #first_newsletter_join?, #subscribed_to_newsletter?,
# #quest_step, #next_quest, #can_change_username?.

  # without firing create callbacks (managed-wallet generation, on-chain account
  # job). The gate-flip test below uses a persisted user (it needs update!).
