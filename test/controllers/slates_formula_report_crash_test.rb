# Regression: /slates/formula_report must render for EVERY slate data state.
# The report's sample tables read odds fields (over_odds, prob, v1..v3) that
# left SlateMatchup in the schema audit (1fd6c50), so any matchup carrying a
# dk_goals_expectation produced a partial sample and 500'd the page — which is
# exactly what happened on prod when NFL 2026 Week 1 became the next slate.
