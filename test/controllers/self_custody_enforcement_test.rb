# Stage 3 enforcement: every code path that would server-sign for a managed
# user MUST refuse to do so once users.self_custodied_at is set.
#
# Today's enforcement points:
#   - ContestsController#enter           — explicit 422 before the managed branch
#   - AccountsController#update_username — route to the co-sign path (build_set_username
#                                          returns a partial TX for the user to sign)
