# Chat quest (v0.23) — the 25-seed bonus fires on a user's FIRST contest-chat
# message only.
#
# HARDENING ("things you can't do"): the controller returns a seeds payload at
# most once, and a wallet-less first message DEFERS the stamp (so the bonus is
# not silently forfeited before there's a wallet to pay). The on-chain
# SeedGrant[chat] PDA is the hard once-ever guard. See MessagesController and its
# private #grant_first_chat_seeds.
