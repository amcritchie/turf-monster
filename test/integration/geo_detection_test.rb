# Integration coverage across the geo-detection I/O boundary (the ipinfo HTTP
# lookup, mocked here at Geocoder.search). Proves that once a lookup succeeds,
# the real detect_geo_state -> normalize_state_code -> GeoSetting blocklist
# pipeline fires end-to-end through GET /geo/check.
#
# COMPLIANCE: the legal-state blocklist FAILS CLOSED. When the gate is enabled
# but the lookup yields no subdivision (a VPN/proxy to an unknown IP, an ipinfo
# outage, or the 3s timeout), geo_state goes blank and geo_country defaults to
# "US" — which could mask a banned state. Such an undetectable US location is
# BLOCKED, never waved through (mirrors Cdp::Catalog's US+nil-subdivision
# fail-closed on the payments path). The earlier http-301 lookup regression
# made this path the norm; the fix here is that an undetectable US location can
# no longer evade the block by breaking geolocation.
