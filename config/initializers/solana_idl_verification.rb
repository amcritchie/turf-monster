# Boot-time IDL hash verification (audit Tier 3 #22).
# In production only — verifies the committed turf_vault IDL hasn't drifted
# from the on-chain program. Raises before the web server accepts connections.
#
# Skip locally + in tests because:
#   - dev DBs often run against an older IDL during iteration
#   - tests stub Solana calls anyway (see test_solana_stubs.rb)
#
# 2026-05-23 (audit H4): the old `SKIP_IDL_VERIFICATION=true` escape hatch
# was removed in production. A leaked Heroku API token + `heroku config:set
# SKIP_IDL_VERIFICATION=true` would otherwise let an attacker swap in a
# poisoned IDL whose account orderings differ from the deployed program,
# causing every Phantom-signed TX to write to attacker-controlled
# accounts. The escape hatch survives only in dev/test, where it never
# protected anything meaningful.
#
# If a controlled mid-upgrade requires temporarily bypassing the check in
# production, the deployer must:
#   1. Set `EXPECTED_IDL_HASH` to the NEW IDL's hash (don't unset it)
#   2. Commit the new IDL JSON
#   3. Deploy
# The whole point is that the env var should never be the kill switch.
#
# Skip during Heroku slug compilation: `assets:precompile` loads the Rails
# environment with SECRET_KEY_BASE_DUMMY=1, but Heroku's build phase does
# NOT expose user-set config vars (BYPASS_IDL_CHECK, EXPECTED_IDL_HASH),
# so the verifier would raise during build even when set correctly for
# runtime. Verification still runs at release-phase + web-dyno boot.

      SKIP_IDL_VERIFICATION is set in production — refusing to boot.

      Audit H4 (2026-05-23) removed this escape hatch. To deploy a new IDL,
      set EXPECTED_IDL_HASH to the new hash and commit the IDL JSON instead.
