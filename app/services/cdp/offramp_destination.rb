module Cdp
  # Resolves the §10 / open-question-3 `to_address` ambiguity ON-CHAIN before
  # any offramp USDC send (docs/CDP_RAMP_INTEGRATION.md): the Offramp
  # Transaction Status API hands us "a Coinbase managed onchain address" but
  # no doc says whether that is an OWNER (wallet) address or an SPL TOKEN
  # ACCOUNT. Sending USDC to the wrong shape strands real funds, so this
  # resolver gates EVERY send (managed server-sign AND Phantom prepare):
  #
  #   1. Fetch the account. Owned by the SPL Token program → it IS a token
  #      account; verify its mint is USDC and use it directly.
  #   2. Anything else (system-owned wallet, or not yet on-chain) → treat it
  #      as an owner address and derive its USDC ATA — which must itself
  #      exist as a token account (we never pay rent to create a
  #      Coinbase-side ATA on a guess).
  #   3. Neither resolves → raise the typed ResolutionError (fail CLOSED; the
  #      first mainnet sell settles the semantics for good).
  #
  # Transient RPC faults propagate as Solana::Client::RpcError so callers can
  # retry; ResolutionError is SEMANTIC (retrying won't help).
