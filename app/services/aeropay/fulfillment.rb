module Aeropay
  # Exactly-once bridge from a validated Aeropay `transaction_completed` to the
  # on-chain mint (Coinflow::Fulfillment parity). Only Webhooks::AeropayController
  # funnels through here — Aeropay's bank-payment flow has no client-side capture
  # leg, so the `transaction_completed` webhook is the single fulfillment source
  # of truth.
  #
  # PERSIST-BEFORE-MINT: the AeropayPurchase row is created (pending) in
  # TokensController#aeropay_order, stamped with the deposit's transaction id,
  # and marked `captured` by begin_fulfillment! here BEFORE TokenPurchaseJob
  # mints anything. We never mint then record — the captured row is the durable
  # record that the settlement happened, so a crash between settlement and mint
  # is recoverable, never a silent double-send (the StripeDepositJob
  # double-transfer trap).
  #
  # SETTLEMENT CAVEAT: for a standard ACH pay-in, `transaction_completed` means
  # APPROVED, not settled (funds final ~3 business days later). Production should
  # prefer the instant RfP/RTP pay-in (irrevocable) so funds are final before
  # this mint fires. See Aeropay::Client#create_deposit.
  module Fulfillment
    # How old a captured-but-unminted row must be before a redelivered webhook
    # treats it as stranded and re-enqueues. A fresh capture is almost always
    # mid-mint; sized past the worst-case mint loop plus the first Sidekiq retry
    # so we never run two jobs concurrently racing the same source_refs.
