module Coinflow
  # Exactly-once bridge from a validated Coinflow settlement to the on-chain
  # mint (Paypal::Fulfillment parity). Only Webhooks::CoinflowController funnels
  # through here — Coinflow has no client-side capture leg, so the `Settled`
  # webhook is the single fulfillment source of truth.
  #
  # PERSIST-BEFORE-MINT: the CoinflowPurchase row is created (pending) in
  # TokensController#coinflow_order and marked `captured` by begin_fulfillment!
  # here BEFORE TokenPurchaseJob mints anything. We never mint then record — the
  # captured row is the durable record that the settlement happened, so a crash
  # between settlement and mint is recoverable, never a silent double-send (the
  # StripeDepositJob double-transfer trap).
  module Fulfillment
    # How old a captured-but-unminted row must be before a redelivered webhook
    # treats it as stranded and re-enqueues. A fresh capture is almost always
    # mid-mint; sized past the worst-case mint loop plus the first Sidekiq retry
    # so we never run two jobs concurrently racing the same source_refs.
