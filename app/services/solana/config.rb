    # IDL hash pinning (audit Tier 3 #22). Catches drift between the Rails
    # app's expected program shape and what's actually deployed on-chain.
    # Workflow:
    #   1. Operator runs `bin/rails solana:verify_idl` (or `anchor idl fetch`)
    #      to download the deployed IDL into config/turf_vault.idl.json
    #   2. Operator runs `bin/rails solana:idl_hash` to print the SHA256
    #   3. Set EXPECTED_IDL_HASH below (or in env) to that value
    #   4. On every boot (production only), the initializer compares the
    #      committed IDL's hash against EXPECTED_IDL_HASH. Mismatch raises.
    #
    # IDL_PATH points at the committed IDL JSON. The file is hand-maintained
    # — updated when turf_vault deploys a new version.
    #
    # Network-keyed (mainnet launch): the devnet and mainnet IDLs are
    # byte-identical EXCEPT the `address` field (the program ID), which makes
    # their SHA256 differ. Each cluster therefore commits its own IDL file and
    # pins its own EXPECTED_IDL_HASH per Heroku app. Selection is by NETWORK so
    # a single source tree boots correctly on either cluster:
    #   - mainnet-beta -> config/turf_vault.mainnet.idl.json (address DaFv…, e13ffd11…)
    #   - anything else (devnet/localnet) -> config/turf_vault.idl.json (address EQGF…, 99d551…)
