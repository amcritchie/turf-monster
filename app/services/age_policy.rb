# Minimum-age policy for entering skill-based contests, by US state.
#
# Mirrors the legal-age copy that the old signup attestation surfaced
# (shared/_age_attestation): 18+ in most states, 19+ in AL/NE, 21+ in
# IA/MA/VA. This is the authoritative server-side source — the entry gate
# (ContestsController) and AgeVerificationsController both compute against it;
# the client modal only renders the number for display.
#
# Age is computed in whole years against the user's DETECTED state (geo_state),
# never a client-supplied state — a VPN/spoof can't lower the bar.
