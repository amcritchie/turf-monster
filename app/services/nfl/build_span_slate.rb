  # Builds (or refreshes) the single Slate that a multi-week contest is played
  # on — e.g. "NFL 2026 Weeks 1-3", holding every game those weeks contain.
  #
  # This is the convergence point for multi-week scoring. A Slate is a POOL OF
  # GAMES, so one span slate holds three games per team, and ranking it stores a
  # FROZEN per-team turf_score on every one of those rows. Scoring then reads the
  # stored value instead of recomputing across a set of weekly slates, which is
  # what let a pick be priced at 1.0x and settled at 3.0x.
  #
  # Refuses rather than truncates:
  #   * a gap in the requested weeks (a "Weeks 1-3" that silently skipped week 2
  #     would be sold as three weeks and scored as two)
  #   * a year with no weekly slates at all
  # Scoping every lookup by YEAR is what keeps a 2026 span from absorbing a 2025
  # slate — slates carry a week but no year column, so the year lives in the name.
