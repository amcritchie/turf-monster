  # Winner-notification email, sent after a contest's on-chain settlement
  # lands (the settle_contest PendingTransaction is confirmed and
  # contest.onchain_settled flips true). Enqueued per winning entry by
  # Contests::WinnerNotifier via WinnerNotificationJob — never sent at grade
  # time, so a winner is only told they won once the payout has actually
  # moved on-chain.
  #
  # `entry` is a winning Entry (payout_cents > 0). The recipient is the
  # entry's user; the notifier guarantees the user has an email before
  # enqueuing (wallet-only winners are skipped upstream).
