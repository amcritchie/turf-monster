# Audit log for PayPal / Venmo token purchases — the PayPal-rails sibling of
# StripePurchase. The minted tokens live on-chain as EntryTokenAccount PDAs in
# turf-vault; this row maps a PayPal order/capture to its on-chain mint TX(s)
# for chargeback / refund forensics.
#
# Pack definitions stay on StripePurchase::PACKS — single source of truth for
# both providers (see StripePurchase.pack).
#
# Status walk: pending → captured → minted, with refunded / failed terminals.
# "captured" is PayPal-specific — the payment cleared (Orders v2 capture
# COMPLETED) but the on-chain mint hasn't finished yet.
