  # every Contest is backed by an on-chain Contest PDA on turf-vault.
  #
  # PRIMARY PATH — Phantom-funded (default for the /contests/new UI):
  #   ContestsController#create builds a partially-signed `create_contest`
  #   TX (admin pays SOL rent, creator slot left for Phantom). User signs
  #   in their wallet → broadcast + confirm → ContestsController#finalize
  #   creates the DB row with `skip_onchain_callback = true` and the
  #   onchain_contest_id / onchain_tx_signature already populated.
  #   See app/views/contests/new.html.erb + Solana::Vault#build_create_contest.
  #
  # FALLBACK PATH — server-funded (Rails console / operator scripts):
  #   `Contest.create!(...)` without `skip_onchain_callback = true` fires
  #   the after_create callback below, which calls `create_onchain!` →
  #   Solana::Vault#create_contest_server_funded. Admin signs as both
  #   payer + creator and funds the prize pool from custodial USDC. If the
  #   on-chain leg fails, the DB row is destroyed and the exception
  #   re-raised — so `create!` is atomic across DB + chain.
  #
  # Opt-out via `skip_onchain_callback = true`:
  #   - The Phantom-funded UI flow sets this on save (Contest is already on-chain).
  #   - Test fixtures + Rails tests (Rails.env.test? auto-skips).

  # (contest_id = sha256(slug)). Override it to a NO-OP for Contest: the slug is
  # set explicitly (UI create path) or backfilled once on create (see
  # #backfill_slug), and is NEVER overwritten from the name afterwards — rename
  # the contest and the slug + its PDA stay put. The slug column + Sluggable's

  # see it free, and then race the insert — the DB unique index on `slug` lets
  # exactly one win and raises ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique on the loser. Only
  # backfilled slugs are auto-regenerated + retried here; an EXPLICIT slug that
  # collides must still surface the validation/uniqueness error to the caller
