  # - `_fetched` lets us memoize a legitimate `nil` (vault not yet
  #   initialized) without re-fetching.
  # - `_error` distinguishes "fetched and confirmed nil" (truly
  #   uninitialized) from "RPC failed, we don't know" — vault_uninitialized?
  #   fails safe to `false` in the latter case so a transient RPC blip
  #   doesn't pop the alarming "Vault Init" navbar badge.
