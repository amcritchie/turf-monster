  # === Allowed emoji ===================================================
  # Reactions are an allowlist, not free-form — the toggle endpoint validates
  # against ALLOWED so a tampered request can't write an arbitrary string into
  # the chat. Three groups:
  #   QUICK   — the themed fixed quick-bar reactions (hundred, gator, sob).
  #             Rendered by messages/_message.html.erb's hover bar — keep the
  #             two in sync.
  #   SPORTS  — the contest-derived first quick reaction (Contest#sport_emoji);
  #             listed so every sport's ball is valid even before that sport
  #             ships a contest type.
  #   PICKER  — the broader palette behind the "+" (Find another reaction).

  # A reaction change re-renders the message's reactions row for everyone in
  # the room (same Turbo Stream channel as the message itself). Best-effort:
  # a cable/Redis hiccup must not fail the toggle that already committed.
