# One row per Coinbase CDP hosted-widget session (onramp = buy USDC into the

# is minted so partner_user_ref ("tm-<user_id>-<id>") exists to correlate the
# widget session with the Transaction Status API + (phase 2) webhooks.
#
# Two status fields, deliberately separate:
#   - status      — OUR local lifecycle (see STATUSES below)
#   - cdp_status  — the raw CDP status string, stored verbatim (the API enum
#                   conflicts between doc pages — handle unknown values
#                   defensively, never case-exhaustively)
#
# coinbase_transaction_id is the idempotency key for poll-job/webhook upserts.
# See docs/CDP_RAMP_INTEGRATION.md §9.
