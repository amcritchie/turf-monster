  # A team appears once per GAME it plays in the slate — a "Weeks 1-3" slate
  # holds three rows per team. Scoped on game_slug rather than the slate alone,
  # which is what used to cap a team at one appearance.
  #
  # This also covers what the DB index can't: game_slug is nullable and PG 14
  # predates NULLS NOT DISTINCT, so the index treats NULL rows as all distinct.
  # Rails generates `game_slug IS NULL` here and catches that case.
