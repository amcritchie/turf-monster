# Audit log for Coinflow entry-token purchases — the Coinflow-rails sibling of
# StripePurchase / PaypalPurchase. The minted tokens live on-chain as
# EntryTokenAccount PDAs in turf-vault; this row maps a Coinflow hosted-checkout
# settlement to its on-chain mint TX(s) for chargeback / refund forensics.
#
# Pack definitions stay on StripePurchase::PACKS — single source of truth for
# every provider (see StripePurchase.pack). "Buy 1 entry" is pack "single"
# (quantity 1, price_cents 19_00).
#
# Status walk: pending → captured → minted, with refunded / failed terminals.
# "captured" is the post-settlement, pre-mint state — Coinflow's `Settled`
# webhook cleared for the exact pack amount but the on-chain mint hasn't
# finished yet.
#
# Money model note: Coinflow is CENTS-native (no decimal strings like PayPal).
# The amount we validate is the SUBTOTAL we set server-side (price_cents), NOT
# the buyer-facing total (subtotal + Coinflow fees) — total varies with fees
# and is not an invariant we control.
