  # v0.16: the `withdraw` on-chain instruction has been removed alongside
  # the custodial-balance model. Managed-wallet USDC now lives in the user's
  # own ATA — there's no pooled vault balance to debit. The replacement is
  # an off-chain payout flow handled by the operator (Kraken/Coinbase + bank
  # wire / Zelle).
  #
  # This action becomes an operator-handoff stub: it flips the TransactionLog
  # to "approved" so it appears in the admin "needs payout" queue, but does
  # NOT execute an on-chain TX. The operator processes the off-ramp manually,
  # then clicks "Complete" (the existing :complete action) to mark fiat-sent.
  #
  # Phase 2 task (separate engagement): replace this stub with a proper
  # PayoutRequest model + Stripe Connect/Zelle/Kraken integration. The
  # TransactionLog row's metadata is the audit trail for that work.
