  # OPSEC-046: admin "act as user" impersonation. The auth seam lives in
  # ApplicationController (true_user / current_user override / impersonating? /
  # verify_session_token binding to true_user). This controller only flips the
  # session flags + writes the ImpersonationLog audit rows.
  #
  # The admin's REAL session (Studio.session_key + :session_token) is never
  # touched — only the three impersonation keys are added/removed, so returning
  # to the admin account is a clean key-delete with no re-auth.

    # impersonating? instead.
