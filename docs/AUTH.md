# Authentication & Account Management

Turf Monster is passwordless. The live sign-in surface is `GET /signin`
(`SessionsController#new`), and legacy `GET /login` / `GET /signup` redirect
there while preserving query params.

## Auth Methods

Users can authenticate through any of these paths:

- **Email magic link** - `POST /magic_link` requests a link, `GET /magic_link/:token` renders a scanner-safe confirmation page, and `POST /magic_link/:token` consumes the token.
- **Google OAuth** - OmniAuth + `GoogleOauthValidator` re-check Google's ID token before linking or creating a user.
- **Solana wallet** - Phantom / Wallet Standard SIWS flow through `SolanaSessionsController`; the server verifies the Ed25519 signature without calling Solana RPC during sign-in.

There is no password login, no password reset, and no `User#authenticate`.
`users.password_digest` remains in the schema only as dormant legacy baggage.

See [SIGNUP_FLOWS.md](SIGNUP_FLOWS.md) for end-to-end flow diagrams.

## Legal-Age Attestation

The underwriting-compliance checkbox is flag-gated by
`AppFlags.age_attestation?` / `ENABLE_AGE_ATTESTATION`.

When the flag is off, the shared checkbox partial renders nothing, client auth
models initialize as already attested, server signup gates pass, and
`age_attested_at` is intentionally not stamped. When the flag is on, brand-new
magic-link, Google, wallet, and fallback `POST /signup` creations must carry the
attestation.

## User Model Auth Design

Current authentication identity lives directly on `users`:

```ruby
has_one_attached :avatar
validates :email, uniqueness: true, allow_nil: true
validates :web2_solana_address, uniqueness: true, allow_nil: true
validates :web3_solana_address, uniqueness: true, allow_nil: true
validates :username, length: { in: 3..30 },
                     format: { with: /\A[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\z/ },
                     uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false },
                     allow_nil: true
validate :has_authentication_method
```

Important invariants:

- `email` is nullable; wallet-only users may not have one.
- Email format uses `User.valid_email?`, shared by model validation and magic-link request handling.
- `has_authentication_method` requires at least one of email, Google `(provider, uid)`, or Solana wallet identity.
- `display_name` falls back through username, name, email prefix, truncated wallet address, then `"anon"`.
- `profile_complete?` is `username.present?`; usernames are auto-generated on create, so normal signups are immediately complete.
- `before_create :set_initial_session_token` writes the OPSEC-045 session-binding token.
- `after_create :generate_managed_wallet!` creates a server-managed Solana wallet for non-admin users.
- `after_commit :enqueue_onchain_account_setup` creates the on-chain username PDA asynchronously.

## Email Magic Links

Routes:

- `POST /magic_link` - request a create-or-login link for an email.
- `GET /magic_link/:token` - inert confirmation page. It does not consume the token, so link scanners cannot burn the login.
- `POST /magic_link/:token` - authoritative consume; signs in an existing user or creates a new one.

The consume step proves email ownership. Existing users with blank
`email_verified_at` are stamped verified on consume. New users are built from
the email in the token, pass through `Studio.configure_new_user`, get the normal
managed-wallet callbacks, then receive a session through `set_app_session`.

Magic-link session setup hard-resets any prior browser session first. This
prevents a previous Phantom/web3 session from leaking `session[:onchain]`,
nonces, return targets, or client wallet state into the new web2 email session.

## Google OAuth

Routes:

- `POST /auth/google_oauth2` - normal OmniAuth request phase.
- `GET /auth/google_oauth2/callback` - callback handled by `OmniauthCallbacksController#create`.
- `GET /auth/google_popup` - popup-mode entrypoint used by the in-contest auth modal.

The callback re-validates Google's ID token with `GoogleOauthValidator` before
trusting `auth.info.email`. `User.from_omniauth(auth, email_verified: true)`
then:

- returns an already-linked `(provider, uid)` user,
- links an existing email user only if that user had already verified email
  ownership, or
- creates a new verified Google user.

If Google collides with a wallet account that has not verified email ownership,
the controller stores a short-lived pending Google identity and asks the user to
prove wallet ownership before linking.

## Solana Wallet Auth

Routes:

- `GET /auth/solana/nonce`
- `POST /auth/solana/verify`
- `GET /auth/phantom/callback` for mobile deep links
- `GET /login/wallet` for the Google-collided-with-wallet recovery path

`Solana::SessionAuth#verify_solana_signature!` enforces:

- a server-generated nonce with a five-minute freshness window,
- delete-before-verify replay protection,
- host binding through the SIWS message, and
- optional session/user binding when linking a wallet to an existing account.

Successful wallet sign-in sets the normal app session and then marks
`session[:onchain] = true`. That flag means the current browser session proved
fresh wallet ownership and may sign on-chain actions. It is distinct from the
account-level `web3_solana_address`, because an account can have a Phantom
wallet linked but currently be signed in via magic link or Google.

Signup itself does not touch Solana RPC. New wallet users get a Rails row and
managed wallet immediately; on-chain `UserAccount` creation is async and
idempotent.

## Account Management

`AccountsController` owns profile, identity, and account-level wallet actions:

- `GET /account` - account settings and identity overview.
- `PATCH /account` - profile update, first email set, or out-of-band email-change request.
- `GET /account/complete_profile` and `POST /account/save_profile` - avatar/profile completion.
- `POST /account/link_solana` - link a Phantom wallet to the current account after a session-bound signature.
- `POST /account/unlink_google` - remove Google OAuth identity.
- `PATCH /account/set_inviter` - one-time inviter/referral binding.
- `POST /account/update_username` and `POST /account/confirm_username` - on-chain username edit.
- `GET /account/session_state` and `GET /account/session_refresh` - client rehydrate endpoints.
- `POST /account/initiate_wallet_export` - send the self-custody export link to the verified email address.

Email changes are out-of-band. Changing an existing email mints a signed token
and emails the current address; the address changes only after the human POSTs
from the confirmation page. Wallet export also uses a signed emailed token and
requires a managed, non-self-custodied account with a verified email.

Identity mutations are blocked while an admin is impersonating another user.

## On-Chain Usernames

Every user gets a DB username and an on-chain `UserAccount` PDA whose username
field mirrors it.

Signup callbacks:

- `before_validation :ensure_username, on: :create` fills `users.username`.
- `after_commit :enqueue_onchain_account_setup, on: :create` enqueues
  `CreateOnchainUserAccountJob`.

Username edits are gated by `User#can_change_username?`, which requires a
connected wallet and at least one contest entry.

Edit flow:

- Managed-wallet users call `POST /account/update_username`; the server signs
  `set_username` and mirrors the DB column.
- Phantom or self-custodied users call `POST /account/update_username`, receive
  a partial transaction, sign in the wallet, then call
  `POST /account/confirm_username`; the server verifies the transaction before
  mirroring the DB column.

## Admin Authorization

- `role` string column on `users`, default `"viewer"`.
- `User#admin?` returns `role == "admin"`.
- `require_admin` comes from `Studio::ErrorHandling`.
- Sidekiq Web has an extra local middleware that requires both admin role and a
  matching `session_token`.

Seeded operator account: `alex@mcritchie.studio`.

## SSO Satellite Role - Removed 2026-05-24

Turf Monster does not accept McRitchie Studio SSO today. Cookie isolation and
local controller overrides make `sso_login` and `sso_continue` return 404.

What changed:

- `config/initializers/session_store.rb` uses an app-specific `_turf_session`
  cookie with no shared `.mcritchie.studio` domain.
- `SessionsController` overrides SSO actions and disables them.
- The old SSO continue partial was removed from the local sign-in view.

Do not restore SSO until the hub/satellite cookie contract is deliberately
redesigned and hardened.

## Route Gotchas

`resource :account` member routes put the action name first. For example,
`unlink_google_account_path` is correct; `account_unlink_google_path` is not.

`/signin` is the canonical human auth page. `POST /login` exists only because
the engine route remains drawn; the local controller redirects stale password
posts back to `/signin` with a magic-link hint.
